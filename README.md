# payroll_system
Java project is designed to manage a payroll system for both full-time and part-time employees. The system is implemented using object-oriented principles, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Project Structure:**
Employee Class:An abstract class representing common attributes and behaviors of all employees.
FullTimeEmployee Class: A class extending the Employee class, specifically designed for full-time employees with a fixed monthly salary.
PartTimeEmployee Class: Another subclass of Employee, tailored for part-time employees with hourly wages.
PayrollSystem Class: A class managing a list of employees, providing functionality to add, remove, and display employee details.

**Features:**
**Abstraction and Inheritance:** Utilizes object-oriented principles for creating an abstract Employee class and specific subclasses.
**Polymorphism:** Demonstrates polymorphism by overriding methods such as calculateSalary and toString in subclasses.
**Flexible Employee Types:** Supports both full-time and part-time employees, allowing for diverse payroll scenarios.
**Payroll Management:** Implements a PayrollSystem class for adding, removing, and displaying employee details.
**Simple Usage Example:** The EmployeeUse class provides a basic example of how to use the Employee Payroll System.

The **EmployeeUse** class demonstrates the basic usage of the Employee Payroll System. It creates instances of full-time and part-time employees, adds them to the payroll system, removes an employee, and displays the remaining employee details.
